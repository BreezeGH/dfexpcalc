# Demonfall EXP Calculator
A very simple open-source Python code to calculate the EXP and bosses required to reach level 50 made by Breeze#5542 on Discord.

Do whatever you want with the code, steal credit for it, piss on it, actually use it to help yourself. Whatever, it literally does not matter. I spent like 3 hours on it.

If you're too lazy to use the .py file, here's a link to a hastebin of the entire code: https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/cuxuqelica.apache

If you're still too lazy to find any of the thousands of compilers sitting around on the Internet to copy and paste that code into: https://www.online-python.com/

If you are STILL too lazy to literally click like 5 buttons to copy and paste the code into a provided online compiler, it's here as well: https://replit.com/@BreezePosts/Demonfall-EXP-Calculator#main.py
