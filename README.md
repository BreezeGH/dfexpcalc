# Demonfall EXP Calculator
###A very simple open-source Python code to calculate the EXP and bosses required to reach level 50 made by Breeze#5542 on Discord.

Do whatever you want with the code, mess around with it, piss on it, actually use it to help yourself. Whatever, it literally does not matter. I spent like 3 hours on it. Just don't steal credit for it, it just makes you look really pathetic for stealing credit for a Python code comprised entirely of variables, ifs, and prints.

The only reason this is on Github is because I'm too lazy to turn it into a website, no matter how easy it might be.

If you're too lazy to use the .py file, you can find the hastebin for the text in the [Releases](https://github.com/BreezeGH/dfexpcalc/releases) and find a compiler.

If you're still too lazy to find any of the thousands of compilers sitting around on the Internet to copy and paste that code into: https://www.online-python.com/

If you are STILL too lazy to literally click like 5 buttons to copy and paste the code into a provided online compiler, it's here as well: https://replit.com/@BreezePosts/Demonfall-EXP-Calculator#main.py
